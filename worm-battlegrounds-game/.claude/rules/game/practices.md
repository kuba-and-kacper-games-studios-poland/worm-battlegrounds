# Game practices

How this game uses ume and ume-gui, and its design decisions, for both folders. They win over the framework's rules
(`family/family.md` → Rules). Their stories: the code folder's `docs/game/lessons.md` (`family/docs.md`).

## Arena

- **Terrain is authored parts,** built like a hand-made map: long parts for the shapes, smaller ones for details, in
  SmoothPlastic with MaterialService's `2022 Stud` variant. Never Roblox Terrain, and never a grid of cells or
  one-stud blocks.
- **Blasts carve with CSG:** `GeometryService:SubtractAsync` with a cylinder whose axis runs along Z (through the
  plane), so craters are smooth and round. `SplitApart` keeps every loose piece its own part; a group of pieces that
  no longer touches the ground falls and anchors again where it lands.
- **Liquids are a stop-motion stud simulation:** water and lava live in a grid of half-stud cells stepped at 8 fps
  and drawn as merged rectangles in `2022 Small Stud`, so they hop like a brick film. They are the only thing in the
  arena on a grid, and the cells stay fine (never one-stud or bigger blocks).

## Worms

- **A worm's state lives in attributes on its model** (`Health`, `Alive`, `Ghost`, `CanMove`, `Stamina`, `Active`…),
  written by the server and read by every client, so the worm modules need no remotes. Overrides `ume/values.md` →
  where a per-player value lives: worm state belongs to the worm, which bots have too, not to a player.
- **The active worm is moved by its player's client** through network ownership; the server only checks speed and
  stamina and takes the worm back. Anything the server does to a worm (knockback, a knockout) happens while the
  server owns it.
- **A walking worm has no grip:** its ball's friction is 0 while it walks, so it slides along walls and up slopes;
  at rest it grips again (`ROOT_FRICTION`).

## Guis

- **The look is the owner's GUI kit (draft 4, adopted 2026-11-04):** windows in a sea-teal gradient with a faint
  diamond pattern, an orange border, a tilted yellow Hazard plate title and a slanted red close; buttons, cards and
  reward frames are 9-slice skin pictures with their outline, light, lip and drop drawn in; things sit on plain
  see-through black slots; framed reward tiles only for rewards being won; Londrina Solid Black for every text. Every
  gui uses the `WormBattlegroundsBrawl` theme, which extends `WormBattlegrounds` (its README describes the kit). The
  gui folder's `brawl-gui` skill makes new guis in it.
- **Yellow leads the eye:** a yellow button is the next thing to press, one per window and three at most on a screen;
  every other button wears its job's colour (blue other actions, green prices, red leave and close, purple modes,
  slate tabs, grey owned or locked).
- **Picked and owned states come from the kit, not from recolouring a face:** a button swaps its skin from the
  attributes on its `Face` (`Kit_Image`, `Kit_SelectedImage`, `Kit_DisabledImage`), a slot shows it's picked by its
  `Body` fill, a rarity is a text colour (`I.Rarity.GetLook(rarity).Base`), and a reward tile takes its rarity's
  frame, stage and light from its `Kit_<Rarity>_*` attributes. Exports can't run the theme's controls, so code reads
  what the controls recorded (the theme's README → Button, Item).
- **Pictures drawn for the game stay local until the owner approves them:** a kit (the game home's
  `assets/_inbox/ui_kit_brawl/`) renders them into Studio's content folder (`rbxasset://textures/wb_brawlpreview/…`)
  and writes the theme's `Icons.lua` and `Skins.lua`. Nothing is uploaded to Roblox before the owner says so; then
  the pictures get PrepKit's pixel-fix, are uploaded, and `Icons.lua` points at their `rbxassetid://` ids. The GUI
  kit is uploaded (2026-11-04); the first kit's item, emote and skin pictures (`wb_guipreview`) are still local.
- **The game's guis are built from the theme's controls** (`WormBattlegroundsBrawl`, over `WormBattlegrounds`),
  never from raw `Primitive` nodes holding their own colours and sizes (as ume-gui's System guis are): `Widget` for
  every WidgetManager widget, `Box` for panels and cards, `Item` for item cards, `Cells` for lists and grids code
  clones rows into, `Picture` for images, and the shared `Label`, `Button`, `Stack`, `Progress`. Restyling the game
  is a theme change (the gui folder's `src/themes/WormBattlegroundsBrawl/_meta/README.md`). Overrides
  `gui/format.md` → Buttons and Surfaces ("other guis, built from `Primitive` nodes").
- **No value controls in a game gui** (`Dropdown`, `Segmented`, `Slider`, `Toggle`, `Input`): exports are static, so
  they do nothing in game. Use buttons the module selects. Preview modules may use them in their `Settings`.
- **Lists code fills use `Cells`,** not the shared `Grid`: `Grid` lays its cells out in code, which exports don't run.
- **Never `Wrap = false` on a `Label`:** scaled text must wrap, and the export refuses it.
- **No `Box` with labels inside a `Fill` row** (`Stack` with `Fill = true`): the labels get no height. Lay such
  content out in a horizontal `Stack` inside one `Box`. `Fill` rows of buttons are fine.
- **No scale-sized frame inside a scale-sized child of an auto-height frame:** Roblox then grows the auto-height frame
  to its parent's full height. Look parts under a `Box` stay direct children (the theme's `Slab` has a Folder root for
  this).
- **Text outlines follow the letters:** a UIStroke on text sets `ApplyStrokeMode = Contextual`, since `ctx.Stroke`
  outlines the box.

## Maps and placeholders

- **Two maps in one place:** `Lobby` and `Match` (`core/.../configs/place_loader.lua`). Each loads the `Default`
  folders (shared by both) plus its own, and its module list leaves out the other map's modules (`MATCH_ONLY`,
  `LOBBY_ONLY`).
- **Studio plays the `Studio` map:** both maps' folders and modules on one server, since Studio can't teleport. The
  lobby hands each match to `I.Match.Host`, and the `InMatch` Player attribute says which half a player is in: every
  screen, camera and hint that belongs to one half follows it instead of assuming its map. A Workspace attribute
  `Ume_StudioMapId` (`Lobby` or `Match`) tests one map alone.
- **Placeholders until the owner provides the real thing:** developer products and game passes keep `Id = 0`; weapon
  projectiles, effects and skins other than Classic are made in code or fall back to the Classic worm. Each such spot
  has a `shortcut:` comment or a README line saying it's a placeholder. Never create products, passes or models on
  the owner's behalf.
- **Panels scale with the screen in position and size:** every game gui's panels are laid out for a 1920 × 1080
  screen. Their positions are screen fractions (`UDim2.fromScale`, never pixel offsets, which don't scale), and their
  size is an `S_ScreenScale` UIScale the ScreenScale module (Utils) sets: by height, by width on a screen narrower
  than 16:9, bigger on short phones. A new gui joins its `GUIS` list instead of scaling itself. A button or tile
  placed on the screen by itself gets its own `S_ScreenScale` (the kit's `Screen` param: the touch buttons, the emote
  button).
- **Device sizes come from ume's platform tags:** a panel that differs per device carries `Utils_PlatformScale` (or
  `Utils_PlatformSize`), and ScreenScale multiplies the screen's scale by the device scale the tag keeps on the
  UIScale (`Utils_BaseScale`). No module or attribute of the game's own does per-device sizing. The GUI kit tags its
  panels 0.75 on Desktop, since it's drawn for phones.
- **Panels hang from a screen edge or corner** (top-left Party, bottom-left Loadout, bottom-centre Play,
  bottom-right Crates), so a per-device size (`Utils_PlatformSize`) never needs a per-device position. On phones and
  tablets a panel too big for the screen gets a Mobile size, its list scrolling, and a Mobile scale under 1 only when
  its content needs the room; a heading that costs a phone too much hides there (`Utils_HideOnPlatform`).
- **Check guis shown together for overlaps** before calling a layout done: PC sizes from 1024 × 768 to 3840 × 2160,
  tablets, and phones down to 667 × 375.
